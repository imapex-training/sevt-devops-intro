## Push

Our two copies of the hello-world repository are not sync'd automatically, to sync them
we need to *push* our local commits to the *remote* copy stored on github

We will push our local changes to the *origin* (github) on the *master* branch

```
git push origin master
```

Refresh the github page and verify that your hello.py file exists
