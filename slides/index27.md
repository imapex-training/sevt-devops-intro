## Cloning

* In the previous exercises, we created a local repository, and created a copy on a remote server (github)

* Cloning is the opposite, we will take a remote repository and copy it to our local development

* Run the following commands:

    ```
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/LAB-PARTNERS-USERID/USERID-hello-world forked-repo

    ```

    This command creates a new directory called forked-repo which contains your partners version of the hello-world project
