## Checking the status of your repository

* Run the following command from your terminal
    ```
    git status

    ```
* Files must be explicitly checked in / tracked by git
* Add your hello.py to version control

    ```
    git add hello.py

    ```
    This adds the file to the *staging index* which means it will be added in the next commit
