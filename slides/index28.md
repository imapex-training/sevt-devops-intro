## Contributing!!!

* Open your partners repository using PyCharm
* Add the following line to the hello.py file
    ```
    print("Put me in coach, I'm ready to play!")
    ```
* Add the modified version of hello.py to your staging index

    ```
    git add hello.py
    ```
* Commit your change
    ```
    git commit -m "modified hello.py"

    ```
* Push your change

    ```
    git push origin master
    ```

Now origin refers to your fork of your partners repository
