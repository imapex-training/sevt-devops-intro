## So What??!

Let's use the git and docker skills we've acquired to do something a bit more useful

1. Use git to clone the following repo

    https://github.com/datacenter/reattivio

2. Change to the reattivio directory

    ```
    cd reattivio
    ```

3. Create a docker image for this project

    ```
    docker build -t reattivio .
    ```
